Astrogaze is an immersive VR experience created by four students from UNC Chapel Hill and Duke for the Triangle VR Hackathon. This experience is designed to educate the user about constellations and give them the experience of finding and drawing them in the night sky. Astrogaze was awarded the "Best of Show" award by a panel of judges from the VR industry. 

Because Astrogaze was developed in a single weekend, we were not able to add all the features we wanted. We planned to add education videos when the user pressed on a constellation in the classroom, a UI in the outside scene to help remind the user of the constellations they are supposed to look for, and help buttons to highlight the first star in the constellations. Also due to time constriant, the experience does not hace a tutorial.

Tutorial:
The interactions with the stars (and UI) are mapped to the right touch controller. To select a star press the right trigger, and then when you select the next star it will draw a connection. If you want to break a connection use the grip button.Because of time constraint we did not get to polish the star interactions to well so it is best to press the trigger and grip rapidly to make sure the interactions are picked up. All the stars are interact-able but there are 6 actual constellations and their stars and connections are green.

We plan to continue development of Astrogaze in the next months and hope to have the finish product published on the Oculus Store and Steam by the end of 2017. 


We hope that you enjoy the experience!
